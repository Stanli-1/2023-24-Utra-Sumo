# 2023-24-Utra-Sumo
Sumo club is an engineering design team under the University of Toronto's Robotics Association (UTRA). The goal is design a fully autonomous robot capable of locating enemy robots and pushing them off a stage. This folder contains the Arduino code written for Utra Sumo 2023-24 competition. In the end, my team and I won first place with a 15/16 record in the UofT year end competition.
